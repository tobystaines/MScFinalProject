======================================

Select one of the following commands to proceed ---->
  run:
    Execute the run() call with debug tensor-watching
  run -n:
    Execute the run() call without debug tensor-watching
  run -t <T>:
    Execute run() calls (T - 1) times without debugging, then execute run() once more with debugging and drop back to the CLI
  run -f <filter_name>:
    Keep executing run() calls until a dumped tensor passes a given, registered filter (conditional breakpoint mode)
    Registered filter(s):
        * has_inf_or_nan
  invoke_stepper:
    Use the node-stepper interface, which allows you to interactively step through nodes involved in the graph run() call and inspect/modify their values
